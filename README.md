# Giveaway-Discord-Bot
Simple discord bot used to contact winners of a giveaway and getting their prize input through DM. Coded in Python.

Running test.py will activate the bot. A user with the "Staff" role can type <b>>notify @user1 @user2..</b> (or their discord tag ex. user#1234) and the bot will DM the winners and ask for an input. 

The reply message will be relayed to a separate discord channel in a server, ex. "user#1234: I would like one prize please!" in channel #giveaway-responses.
